# megabyte112-RP-updater
A tool for quickly updating the megabyte112 Minecraft resource pack.
Note that this is for Windows only.

Download from the releases tab, and extract into a folder in the \resourcepacks folder (like \resourcepacks\update)
Open the update folder (make sure there's no double folders)
Make sure the resource pack is NOT loaded in minecraft!
- Either close minecraft or deselect the resource pack and click "done"
Run the updater.exe file

It will automatically download the file from GitHub and place it in the resourcepacks folder, replacing any outdated packs.
