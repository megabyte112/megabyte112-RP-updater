# megabyte112-RP-updater
A tool for quickly installing or updating the megabyte112 Minecraft resource pack.

Note that this is for Windows only, and for 64-bit systems.

Download from the releases tab, and install like a regular resource pack.

The file should be in the \resourcepacks folder, where resource packs are saved.

Make sure the resource pack is NOT loaded in minecraft!
Either close minecraft or deselect the resource pack and click "done"

Now you can run the updater.exe file, and click "Install" or "Update".
It will automatically get the latest release from GitHub and save it to your resoucepacks folder, ready to select as a resource pack.
It can also catch and tell you about any errors, such as being in the wrong folder.

Windows sometimes seems to think this is malicious, just click "more options" and "run anyway" if asked. (I can't find a way to fix this)
