# megabyte112-RP-updater
A tool for quickly updating the megabyte112 Minecraft resource pack.
Note that this is for Windows only.

Download from the releases tab, and extract into a folder in the \resourcepacks folder (like \resourcepacks\update)
Open the update folder (make sure there's no double folders)
Run the updater.exe file

First it will scan your downloads folder for an older version on the resource pack, and remove if necessary.
Then it will open the GitHub releases page for the resource pack. You must download the latest version to your downloads folder.
Then, return to the program and press enter to copy to Minecraft.
