# megabyte112-RP-updater
A tool for quickly installing or updating the megabyte112 Minecraft resource pack.

Note that this is for Windows only, and for 64-bit systems.

Download from the releases tab, and install like a regular resource pack.

The file should be in the \resourcepacks folder, where resource packs are saved.

Make sure the resource pack is NOT loaded in minecraft!

Either close minecraft or deselect the resource pack and click "done"

Now you can run the updateRP.exe file.

Windows sometimes seems to think this is malicious, just click "more options" and "run anyway" if asked. (I can't find a way to fix this)

It will automatically download the file from GitHub and place it in the resourcepacks folder, replacing any outdated packs.

It can also identify if there's an error, such as the resource pack being loaded in minecraft, or being in the wrong folder.
